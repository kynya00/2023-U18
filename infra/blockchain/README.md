# Blockchain

This directory has everything necessary to host a private blockchain based on Ethereum for a competition.

Testchain is created with Anvil, which is a part of [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry), modular toolkit for developing blockchain apps.

Running the chain is pretty straightforward, just run `docker-compose up` and you are good to go!
